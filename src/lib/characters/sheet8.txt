----------CHARACTER SHEET----------

Name: Clara  
Class: In-Flight Enigma
Race: Human (with possible aeromantic abilities)  

Strength (13): Can fly through the cabin of an airplane with ease, but struggles to lift a suitcase into the overhead bin.  

Weakness (11): Turbulence, running out of in-flight snacks, and people who don't understand her unique language.  

Fear (8): Crashing, losing her in-flight magazine, and being seated next to a chatty passenger.  

Agility (15): Can dodge drink carts and leap over seatbacks with ease, but trips over her own feet when trying to exit the plane.  

Morality (9): Generally Neutralâ€”unless you're a fan of John Cena, then it's Unwavering Devotion.  

Fame (19): Known by almost everyone in the world, with a reputation that's both revered and reviled, like a flying Marmite.  

Special Abilities: Can fly inside an airplane, see John Cena even when he's not there, and speak a language that's incomprehensible to everyone, including herself, but somehow still manages to order a decent in-flight meal.  


Backstory:
Clara's life is a mystery, even to herself, as she soars through the skies, speaking a language that only she can't understand, and seeing visions of John Cena everywhere she goes, all while trying to navigate the complexities of in-flight etiquette and avoiding the dreaded middle seat.
