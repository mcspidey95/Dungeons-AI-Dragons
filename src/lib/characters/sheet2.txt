Backstory:
Aphrodite is a self-proclaimed goddess who rules over her own little world of TV shows and academic excellence, but her lack of street smarts and physical strength often lands her in trouble, and her ego usually gets the best of her, making her come across as arrogant and clueless about the real world.
